dates: 03/2021-05/2021.

## Work's description
There are **seven** laboratory works for studying the tools of the OpenCV library. 
The source code and the results are presented in the form of reports (.md files) for convenient verification. 
The works are aimed at studying the main tools for working with images using OpenCV. 

Various methods of image correction (brightness, contrast), working with different lighting in the image (bright rays or shadows), highlighting the image borders and creating "scans" from photos were considered.
